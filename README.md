### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use the "<span>" tag, yes, I'm a newbie XD. But I'm proud of it, everyone should start it from somewhere right? Look beyond some parts that I used.

```html
      <section class="score">
        <h1 class="titulo_resultado">Your Result</h1>
        <h2 class="nota">76 <span>of 100</span></h2>
        <h3 class="nota_descritivo">Great</h3>
        <p class="descricao">You scored higher than 65% of the people who have taken these tests.</p>
      </section>

        <ul class="summary_itens">
          <li class="reaction"><img src="assets/images/icon-reaction.svg" alt="">Reaction<span> </span><span><b>80</b> / 100</span></li>
          <li class="memory"><img src="assets/images/icon-memory.svg" alt="">Memory<span> </span><span><b>92</b> / 100</span></li>
          <li class="verbal"><img src="assets/images/icon-verbal.svg" alt="">Verbal<span> </span><span><b>61</b> / 100</span></li>
          <li class="visual"><img src="assets/images/icon-visual.svg" alt="">Visual<span> </span><span><b>72</b> / 100</span></li>
        </ul>
```
```css
.results_summary_component .score span {
    font-size: 14px;
    color: hsl(241, 100%, 89%, 0.4);
}

.summary .summary_itens span {
    color: hsl(224, 30%, 27%, 0.7);
}
```

### Continued development

It's on my planning to do some improvements to look better and most similar with the example. The spacing between the words from the right part it's one thing that I need to improve, don't really now how to do this for now but gonna change very soon.
